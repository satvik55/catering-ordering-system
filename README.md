## üìñ Getting Started: How to Run the Project Locally

**Important:** You cannot run this project by opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser. It must be served by a local web server to allow communication with the Firebase backend.

### Method 1: The Easy Way (Using VS Code + Live Server)

This is the simplest method if you use Visual Studio Code.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
    * The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension installed from the VS Code marketplace.
2.  **Clone the Repository** and open the project folder in VS Code.
3.  **Right-click** on the `index.html` file.
4.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**. Your browser will open with the project running.

### Method 2: The Standard Way (Using the Terminal)

This method works for any code editor.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * You must have the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository** and navigate into the project folder in your terminal.
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/satvik55/student-teacher-booking-app.git](https://github.com/satvik55/student-teacher-booking-app.git)
    cd student-teacher-booking-app
    ```
3.  **Start the Local Server** using the Firebase CLI.
    ```sh
    firebase serve
    ```
4.  **View the Project** by opening your browser to **`http://localhost:5000`**.
